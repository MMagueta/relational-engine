* Check if temporary file with the command hash with exists
To hash the command, we must hash its bytes without the timestamp,
since it will always vary given it's a transactional time, and add
instead the commit HEAD of the state of the database.

If such file exists, load the transaction and storage offsets
alongside the command and attempt to write it as a recovery.
* Get the transaction offset of the transaction graph file AND storage file
* Write the offsets to a tmp file
* Write the command with a flag **flushed** set to false to a tmp file
* Attempt to execute the command
* Delete the temporary file
